In this chaotic world, we all should give our best to help others survive. The best way is to apply 1% strategy. If you are a student, then you must spend 1% time of your day and also 1% of your pocket money for this purpose. If you are a professional and have a stable source of income. Then you must spend 1% of your income and if possible then 1% of you time also. By applying this strategy, you will see a big change not only in your surroundings but also in your daily life inshaAllah.
